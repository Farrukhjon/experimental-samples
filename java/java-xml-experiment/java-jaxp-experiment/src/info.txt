The Java API for XML Processing (JAXP) is for processing XML data using applications written in the Java programming language.
JAXP leverages the parser standards Simple API for XML Parsing (SAX) and Document Object Model (DOM) so that you can choose
to parse your data as a stream of events or to build an object representation of it.
JAXP also supports the Extensible Stylesheet Language Transformations (XSLT) standard,
giving you control over the presentation of the data and enabling you to convert the data to other XML documents or to other formats,
such as HTML. JAXP also provides namespace support, allowing you to work with DTDs that might otherwise have naming conflicts.
Finally, as of version 1.4, JAXP implements the Streaming API for XML (StAX) standard.

							-=Overview of the Packages=-
 The SAX and DOM APIs are defined by the XML-DEV group and by the W3C, respectively.
 The libraries that define those APIs are as follows:
 - javax.xml.parsers: The JAXP APIs, which provide a common interface for different vendors' SAX and DOM parsers.
 - org.w3c.dom: Defines the Document class (a DOM) as well as classes for all the components of a DOM.
 - org.xml.sax: Defines the basic SAX APIs.
 - javax.xml.transform: Defines the XSLT APIs that let you transform XML into other forms.
 - javax.xml.stream: Provides StAX-specific transformation APIs.
							
							-=SAX Packages=-
			Packages				Description

	- org.xml.sax			Defines the SAX interfaces. The name org.xml is the package prefix that was settled on by the group that defined the SAX API.
	- org.xml.sax.ext		Defines SAX extensions that are used for doing more sophisticated SAX processing-for example, to process a document type definition (DTD) or to see the detailed syntax for a file.
	- org.xml.sax.helpers	Contains helper classes that make it easier to use SAX-for example, by defining a default handler that has null methods for all the interfaces, so that you only need to override the ones you actually want to implement.
	- javax.xml.parsers		Defines the SAXParserFactory class, which returns the SAXParser. Also defines exception classes for reporting errors.
