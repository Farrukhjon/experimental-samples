Dependency Injection (DI) - is a software design pattern and part of SOLID priciple 
	separation Data and Behavior ob Object; Depend upon Abstraction but Do not depend 
	upon Concretion. 

DI involves four elements:
 1) Implementation of the Service object (AImpl, BImpl and CImpl);
 2) The client object depending of the service (ClientClass);
 3) The interface that Client (Demo) use to communicate with the Service
 4) The injector object which responsible for injectiong(in our case Factory object).
